# PredictingFootballerValue

The term “Moneyball” was coined back in 2002 when the Oakland Athletics built a baseball team of undervalued players based on statistics. You may have even seen the film called “Moneyball”. This strategy is especially important for clubs that have lower budgets. Football clubs pay millions to purchase football players. A Model that can predict a player’s value would help club managers make informed decisions on how much they should pay for a player with certain attributes. Additionally, such a model could help managers “bargain” players that would perform almost as well as top players.  Now, whether or not these statistics do not apply to their  real player counterparts, this model could still be useful for managing fantasy football teams. 

The goal of this project was to create a model that was able to predict a player’s value (i.e. is he worth the money). This project highlights data wrangling, informative visualizations, and machine learning models such linear regression, and ensemble regressors like Gradient Boosting.
